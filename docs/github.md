We are using github for project management, hosting, and long form discussion. Some of the repos are used primarily for development, while others are intended primarily for Github's `issues` functionality.

### Important Repos

- [Ideas](https://github.com/1Hive/ideas): Issues in this repository are used for discussion of potential projects or initiatives that 1Hive could pursue. Ideas are meant for discussion and coordination, they do not need to be fully fleshed out proposals.

- [1Hive Website](https://github.com/1hive/website): This site! It is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) and hosted using Github Pages. We maintain community documentation, our blog, and other useful content here. Most content can be updated using Markdown, please see the [contributor guide](https://github.com/1Hive/website/blob/master/README.md) for more information.

### Common Patterns

To help new members navigate our Github organization we try and maintain consistent patterns across all of our repositories.

#### Contribution Guide

All repos should use include a Contribution Guide in the `README.md` file in the repositories root directory. This file should explain how people should explain what the repository contains and how people should can contribute.

#### Task Bounties and Issue Tags

As discussed in the [Projects and Tasks](docs/contribute/projects-tasks) section of this guide, we use the **Projects** app in the 1Hive organization to coordinate and reward effort on specific tasks which are represented by Github issues.

Currently there is no way to view the funding status of an issue within Github, though this should be solved by a github bot in the future. For now, we expect **Curators** to manually attach the `Funded` tag to issues after they have been funded. And we expect **Workers** to assign themselves to issues after they have been assigned a task in the Aragon organization.
