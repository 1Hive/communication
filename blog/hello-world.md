# Hello World

Starting to draft ideas on a blog post announcing 1Hive.

The current iteration is a dramatic intro added to the beginning of the awesome [welcome page in the docs](https://1hive.org/docs/contribute/welcome.html).

## Draft 0.0.1

For too many years have brilliant and revolutionary ideas languished in the archives. For too many years have people had to choose between personally meaningful work and sustainable work. For too many years has open source been sustained via altruism. It doesn't have to be this way...

We have decentralized infrastructure to verify and execute code anytime anywhere. We have applications that allow us collectively manage organizations at scale. We have magic internet money to make it sustainable. For the first time in human history a group of people who've never met can collaborate across borders to building something together that the whole world can use, and they can do so in a way that is positive-sum and sustainable. This is happening now. It's called 1Hive and the Hive Commons License. 

1Hive is a decentralized autonomous organization working to grow the open source commons by contributing to research, development, and documentation related to open source sustainability. We are changing the way people think about and build open source software.

We believe that improving how we collaborate and recognize contributions to open source communities will help grow the open source software commons. We also believe that advocating for an abundant open source software commons is the best way to mitigate social risks associated with the broad integration of technology into our economic systems and societies.

We see incredible potential in decentralized autonomous organizations to improve how we govern open source projects and track and reward contributors, despite the ecosystem and tools still being very much in their infancy. By using an Aragon organization on a daily basis to organize our community, we are able to benefit from a strong feedback loop between our experiences and our contributions.

We recognize that the biggest challenge in expanding the open source software commons is in finding ways to adequately fund the efforts of open source contributors. This sparked the idea for Apiary, a bonding curve based crowdfunding mechanism for DAOs. It is also the underlying motivation behind the commons license, which we are currently exploring as the foundation of a more sustainable open source software licensing model.

We are documenting our processes here in order to help new community members get involved and up to speed on how we work together. However, the guide is also intended to be used as a template for other open source communities to adopt and remix. Our process is an ongoing experiment that is continuously evolving as we learn and improve!

If you find anything unclear, please join our keybase and ask us or open an issue so that we can help!
